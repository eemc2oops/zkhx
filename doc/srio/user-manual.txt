The S-RIO MAC contains an ingress packet buffer (PBMi) that is implemented as a shared memory among multiple queues  with 288 data nodes of 32 bytes each
ingress packet buffer   有 288个 nodes，每个nodes有32字节


The Tsi721 supports two S-RIO error reporting methods:
• To remote S-RIO host through generating S-RIO port-write packets (see S-RIO Event Management)
• To local PCIe root complex through PCIe INTx/MSI/MSI-X (see Interrupt Handling)

DMA descriptors reside in main memory connected through the PCIe Interface. For a DMA descriptor indicating a S-RIO
NREAD or S-RIO maintenance read

For a DMA descriptor indicating an S-RIO NWRITE/SWRITE/NWRITE_R, or a S-RIO maintenance write, DMA data source is
main memory, source address is PCIe address in DMA descriptor
